# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `app/` contains the Django project settings (`settings.py`), URL router, and WSGI/ASGI entrypoints.
- Feature apps live in `cadmember/`, `finance/`, `accounts/`, and `api/` (models, views, forms, urls, migrations).
- Templates are organized under `app/templates/` and per-app template folders when applicable.
- Static assets live in `static/`.
- Utility scripts: `bulk_insert_members.py`, `reproduce_issue.py`, and `test_url.py`.
- SQLite database for local dev is `db.sqlite3` (generated by migrations).

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` — install Python dependencies.
- `python manage.py migrate` — apply database migrations (creates `db.sqlite3`).
- `python manage.py runserver` — run the local Django dev server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
- `python manage.py makemigrations` — generate migration files after model changes.
- `python manage.py test` — run Django test suite.
- Docker: `docker build -t membro1.0 .` then `docker run -p 8000:8000 membro1.0` for a containerized dev server.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Python: 4-space indentation, PEP 8 style, snake_case for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes.
- Django conventions: keep models in `models.py`, views in `views.py`, URLs in `urls.py`, and migrations under `migrations/`.
- Template and static naming should be descriptive and scoped by feature (e.g., `cadmember/member_detail.html`).

## Testing Guidelines
- Tests use Django’s built-in `TestCase` (`*/tests.py` in each app).
- URL checks can be run via `python test_url.py` when validating route resolution.
- Prefer naming tests as `test_<behavior>` for clarity (e.g., `test_member_create`).

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commit history is mixed: mostly imperative sentences, with occasional `feat:` prefixes. Prefer short, imperative subjects (e.g., “Add member CPF validation”).
- PRs should include: a concise description, linked issue or context, and screenshots for UI/template changes.
- Note any migration files in the PR description and verify `python manage.py test` passes.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Local settings use SQLite and `DEBUG=True`; do not rely on these settings for production.
- Avoid committing secrets; use environment variables for production settings when extending `settings.py`.
